# recreate
My motivation for creating this portfolio is to be able to better understand the working of Bootstrap. Learning and creating this material from scratch will help me achieve my goal of becoming a Full Stack developer. 
My portfolio shows that I am able to do that. I am hoping in the future any mistakes  that were made can be corrected. Hopefully in the future I may come back to this and showcase what new coding languages I have learned to create a much more dynamic portfolio.
# Usage
This portfolio will be used to showcase my skills to future employers with bootstrap.
# Credits
One website that I happen to use quite a bit to execute this portfolio is https://www.w3schools.com/html/. Your more than welcome to use them.
I also would like to give credit to the study group of guys who helped me out. Those guys were Thomas, Cleveland, and Devainte. They were able to show me more than one pair of eyes is able to break down a problem.
Special credit goes to the team of instructors. Without their help; this portfolio wouldn't have been possible.
